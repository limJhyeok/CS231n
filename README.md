# Stanford CS231n Assignments (2021 Version)

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments from Stanford's **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** course (Spring 2017), completed using the 2021 assignment version.

## About the Course

Stanford's CS231n is one of the most renowned deep learning courses, offering an in-depth exploration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in computer vision. It covers topics such as:

- Image classification
- CNN architectures
- Transfer learning
- Object detection and segmentation
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers in vision
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
- Self-Supervised Learning

If you're passionate about artificial intelligence, this course is an excellent learning resource.

## ⚠️ Caution

Please note that there might be some errors in my implementations, particularly in the **Batch Normalization** and **Dropout** sections. While I made efforts to fix these issues, debugging them completely proved challenging.
