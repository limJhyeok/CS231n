# Stanford CS231n
Assignments version: 2021

!Caution: There could be some erros in the assignment especially batch norm and dropout. I have tried to fix my erros but it was hard to find.
So if you think my code is something wrong then you could trust yourself.
I really enjoyed following Stanford CS231n course. if you are looking for A.I lecture, I strongly recommend you to see this course and follow assignments.
